Pretrained networks are a good way to start your project as they are usually trained on large amounts of data and using resources that arenâ€™t usually available to everyone. Based on the feature maps inside CNN you can see the focus (attention) of the network as well as perform coarse localisation.

Topics included in this DEMO:
* Image classification wth CNN pretrained on imagenet database
* Object localisaton based on CAMs (WSL introduction)
